###
#FileHandler.py
###
API library for loading SDF, SLN, SMILES, and (custom) WikiSrapedDB file
types. SDF, SLN, and SMILES formats allow transformation of file objets
to rdkit MorganFingerprints and rdkit Mol objects.
WikiSrapedDB creates a list of FileObjects.DrugEffects objects.


###
#FileObjects.py
###
API library for creating a DrugEffects object.
DrugEffects: container for drug name, # side effects, # gene expression
interactions, and SMILES string


###
#basic_stats_plotting.py
###
Loads SLN file of PAINS and SDF file of alternative chemical screen set to
convert to rdkit MOl and Fingerprints to compare:
Histograms: pairwise tanimoto similarities within PAINS and within alternative
chemical screen set.
Heatmap: broken...


###
#build_promiscuity_index_from_stitch.py
###
Takes in a chemical smiles structure with chem id, merges it with the
interactions file to build a new file with the chemid, smiles and # of
interactions combined.


###
#butina_clustering_PAINS.py
###
rdkit based similarity clustering method for chemcial structures


###
#compress_dsig_file.py
###
Deprecated.
Compresses the total drug interaction file from Aqeel to count the interactions
and print out to a single file (losing the actual interaction properties
information.)
ToDo: debug problem in change in fields middle of file


###
#fda_approved_smiles_wikipedia_scrape.py
###
TAkes in Joe's comma-delimited list of FDA approved drugs. Scrapes wikipedia
for smiles and outputs result as a set of smiles. (small molecule drugs only)


###
#hclust_PAINS.py
###
Attempts to use hierarchical clustering on 2048 bit vector fingerprint
of PAINS (via rdkit) for unsupervised clustering.
Deprecated: does not perform well with binary values in vector


###
#kmeans_cluster_of_pca_reduction.py
###
PCA dimensionality reduction on 2048 bit vector of fingerprints for given SLN
file (presumably for my PAINS). K-means on PC1 vs PC2 result to break apart
potential clusters. Recursively runs through number of k clusters to
potentially find best cluster.


###
#knn_analysis.py
###
Train PAINS against a given chemical set to train by knn. Tests and prints out
specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, F1, FDR for various parameters of knn.


###
#linear_svc_analysis.py
###
Train PAINS against a given chemical set to train by linear svc. Currently
only uses a C=1.0. Cross validation to check.


###
#lregress_predicted_PAINS.py
###
Performs a scatterplot of probability of random forest predictor as
compared to the number of side effects of drug and the number of
gene expression change effects.


###
#pca_plot_on_fp.py
###
principal component analysis of PAINS and PAINs vs control set to see clustering
of data based on fingerprints.


###
#random_forest_analysis.py
###
Given classifiers and data (PAINS and alternative chemcial set) trains
random forest. Tries multiple different tree length parameters for
sensitivity, specificity, F1, accuracy,


###
#scrape_wikipedia_for_smiles.py
###
TAkes in Aqeel's list of FDA approved drugs with number of side effects
and number of gene expression change interactions and scrapes wikipedia
for the smiles string associated witht hat drug. prints info back out to
stdout
