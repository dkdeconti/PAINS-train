        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>PAINS train is an attempt to use machine learning to identify
          false positives in chemical drug screens caused by pan assay
          interference compounds (PAINS). The basis for the PAINS classification
          is a 2010 paper by J.B. Baell<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>,
          in which PAINS were empirically derived
          from a large, diverse chemical screen.<br><br>

          More than 350 PAINS were identified and their structure was encoded in a
          SYBYL/SLN string. As a sample for the non-PAINS aspect of the
          training set, a random sampling (4,000 molecules) of chemicals from
          the ChEMBLdb version 20 was used.<br><br>

          RdKit was used for all SMILES, SDF, and SYBYL/SLN format translation,
          fingerprinting, and conversion of features to a bit array. A bit array
          of structural features was created for the training sets. A PCA of
          the two classifiers (PAINS and ChEMBL) showed a tight clustering of
          PAINS.<br>

                width="400"></p><br>
          As a further control, I compared the STITCH version 4.0 chemical
          database of >82 million unique chemicals (randomly subsampled) to
          the PAINS set through PCA.<br>
          <img src="../static/img/pains_vs_stitch-12.png"
               width="400"><br>
          I chose a random forest classifier due to the features representation. The
          features were transformed Morgan fingerprints to a 2,048 length bit
          vector. As a bit vector, the lack of a continuous variable removes
          many clustering methods as options. This fact combined with the
          ambiguity as to the of dependence of points between each other in the
          vector made a random forest classifier an appropriate method for the
          classification.<br>

          Comparison of the performance of the random forest to knn
          reinforces the notion that random forest is a better performer.<br>
          <img src="../static/img/knn_training_optimization.png"
               width="400"><br><br>
          I tested the random forest model against
          a cohort of FDA approved drugs and data regarding the number of
          side effects and the number of major gene expression changes. This
          data was obtained from
          <a href="http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/DSigDB/DSigDBv1.0/">DSigDB</a>. I
          compared the probability prediciton of PAINS classification by
          the rando forest model to both the number of side effects and the
          number of major identified gene expression changes. There was no
          correlation with either factor, and no drugs were actually classified
          as a PAINS. However, above a certain probability of PAINS prediction
          there were no drugs with a low number of side effects.<br>
